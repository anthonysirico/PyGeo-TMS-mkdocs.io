  abstract = 	 {Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. Luckily, several promising and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.}

abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.}

  abstract = {This paper discusses two-terminal series-parallel networks occurring in Applied Probability and other contexts where the mathematical theory of reliability is developed. Eighty years ago Mac Mahon successfully discussed the number of different structures built of n identical components [1]; later Knödel [3] and Carlitz and Riordan [4] in the 1950's investigated the number of different structures built of n different components. However, in many new applications, engineers and statisticians have to study structures having n components with a specification defining various types of components and stating how many identical components of each kind should be used. This general problem is investigated in Section 7 whilst in Sections 1-6 results obtained earlier are presented and it is shown there how modern approaches to combinatorics (particularly Pólya's Enumerative Combinatorial Analysis) can simplify some reasoning of previous authors.},

These range from standard classics, such as the characterization of line graphs by eigenvalues, to more unusual areas, such as geometric embeddings of graphs and the study of graph homomorphisms. The authors' goal has been to develop each topic in a self-contained fashion, presenting the main tools and ideas, with an emphasis on their use in understanding concrete examples. A substantial proportion of the book covers topics that have not appeared in book form before, and as such it provides an accessible introduction to the research literature and to important open question in modern algebraic graph theory." "This book is primarily aimed at graduate students and researchers in graph theory, combinatories, or discrete mathematics in general. However, all the necessary graph theory is developed from scratch, so the only prerequisite is a first course in linear algebra and a small amount of elementary group theory. Thus, it should also be accessible to motivated upper-level undergraduates."--Jacket.},

    abstract = {Static bug detection has shown its effectiveness in detecting well-defined memory errors, e.g., memory leaks, buffer overflows, and null dereference. However, modern software systems have a wide variety of vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are extremely complicated with sophisticated programming logic, and these bugs are often caused by different bad programming practices, challenging existing bug detection solutions. It is hard and labor-intensive to develop precise and efficient static analysis solutions for different types of vulnerabilities, particularly for those that may not have a clear specification as the traditional well-defined vulnerabilities.This article presents DeepWukong, a new deep-learning-based embedding approach to static detection of software vulnerabilities for C/C++ programs. Our approach makes a new attempt by leveraging advanced recent graph neural networks to embed code fragments in a compact and low-dimensional representation, producing a new code representation that preserves high-level programming logic (in the form of control- and data-flows) together with the natural language information of a program. Our evaluation studies the top 10 most common C/C++ vulnerabilities during the past 3 years. We have conducted our experiments using 105,428 real-world programs by comparing our approach with four well-known traditional static vulnerability detectors and three state-of-the-art deep-learning-based approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our research and have shed light on the promising direction of combining program analysis with deep learning techniques to address the general static code analysis challenges.},
