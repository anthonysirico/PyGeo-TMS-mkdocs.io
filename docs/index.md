<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Geometric Deep Learning for Graph-Based Engineering Designs</h1>

Geometric Deep Learning (GDL)[^1] for Graph-Based Engineering Designs is a project that applies graph theory methods towards system architectures and representing them as graphs.
Those generated graphs are then used to train a machine learning model consisting of a Graph Neural Network (GNN).
